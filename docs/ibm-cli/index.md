# Examples of interacting with the IBM Cloud CLI
A collection of examples for interacting with the IBM Cloud CLI. 

## Where are you running the commands?
 - If you plan to use your desktop/laptop, see the [Local Prerequisites](#local-prerequisites) section. 
 - If you cannot install tools on your desktop/laptop, follow the [Cloud Shell](#cloud-shell) instructions.

### Local Prerequisites
 - [IBM Cloud CLI](https://cloud.ibm.com/docs/cli?topic=cli-install-ibmcloud-cli) installed
 - [jq](https://stedolan.github.io/jq/) installed
**OR**
 - [bxshell](https://github.com/l2fprod/bxshell) installed. This is a docker image with IBM and cloud-native tools baked in. 

### Cloud Shell
IBM Cloud Shell is a free service that gives you complete control of your cloud resources, applications, and infrastructure, from any web browser. It’s instantly accessible from your free IBM Cloud account—no other installation is needed.

#### Cloud Shell setup
 - Open the IBM Cloud console (cloud.ibm.com) in your browser and log in if needed.
 - Invoke Cloud Shell by clicking on the button at the top, right-hand corner of the browser window.
